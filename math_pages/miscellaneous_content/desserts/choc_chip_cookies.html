								Some typical chocolate chip cookies except that these are gluten free. This recipe comes from the
                package of the gluten free flour Better Batter. Anyone who is very sensitive to gluten will also need
                to verify that the other added ingredients (aside from the gluten free flour) are sufficiently gluten free.
                It also worth noting that one of the gluten free flour's ingredients is xanthan gum, which has been known
                to cause issues to individuals with severe gluten intolerance (e.g. individuals who have celiac disease).
                However, these symptoms seem to vary from individual to individual as I know someone with celiac disease,
                yet they have no issue with this gluten free flour. So the search for a recipe for those who have a more
                severe gluten intolerance continues. The cookies produced from this recipe are still nonetheless pretty good.
                This recipe produces about two dozen.

						<h2>Instructions</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-12-medium">
								<h3>Dough</h3>
								<ul>
                  <li>Ahead of time, make sure the stick of unsalted butter is at room temperature and not still hard from being cold in the fridge.</li>
                  <li>Place 12 ounces of semi sweet chocolate chips in the medium bowl.</li>
                  <li>In a large bowl add 3/4 of a cup of granulated sugar and 3/4 of a cup of packed brown sugar.</li>
									<li>Take the 2 and 1/4 cups of the gluten free flour, and place a few tablespoons of it in the medium bowl with the chocolate chips. Place the rest of the gluten free flour in the large bowl with the sugars.</li>
									<li>Take the stick of unsalted butter and place it in the large bowl and start beating together the ingredients. Break up the butter as much as possible.</li>
                  <li>Beat in all the eggs one at a time into the large bowl. Then beat in 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. Make sure all the ingredients are well blended.</li>
                  <li>Now take the 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and sprinkle a small portion into the medium bowl with the chocolate chips and add the rest to the large bowl.</li>
                  <li>Now take the 1 teaspoon of baking soda and sprinkle a small portion into the medium bowl with the chocolate chips and add the rest to the large bowl.</li>
                  <li>Mix the ingredients together in the large bowl. At this point it should be well blended and elastic.</li>
                  <li>Toss the chocolate chips in the medium bowl so that they are coated by the dry ingredients.</li>
                  <li>Add the chocolate chips into the large bowl and stir them altogether so that the chocolate chips are evenly distributed.</li>
                  <li>If you decide to bake the cookies at a later time/day go ahead and cover the bowl and stick it in the fridge for no more than a few days. You can save it for longer if stored in the freezer.</li>

								<h3>Baking the Cookies</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                  <li>Grab the two baking sheets and line them parchment paper.</li>
                  <li>Start grabbing chunks of dough and rolling them into balls about 1 and 1/4 inches in diameter.</li>
                  <li>Place the dough balls on the baking sheets spacing them out so that 12 can fit on each sheet.</li>
                  <li>If the dough has already been refriderated then they can be put in the oven once it finishes preheating. Otherwise, stick the baking sheets with the dough balls in the freezer for a few minutes before placing in the oven.</li>
                  <li>Bake the cookies for around 15 minutes, but 2/3 of the way through check on the cookies for a few things:
                    <ol>
                      <li>If the edges of the cookies are beginning to brown and the rest is lightly brown then the cookies are done.</li>
                      <li>If the cookies are still very round (a consequence of either too much egg, too cold, or both), then to fix their shape just take a metal spoon and press the center of the cookies and around the edges until they get their classic cookie shape.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>If you made the dough balls larger than needed and have fewer than 24 dough balls, that is still fine, you may just need to bake them for 5 - 15 minutes longer. Still perform the same check above about 2/3 of the way through their baking.</li>
                </ul>
