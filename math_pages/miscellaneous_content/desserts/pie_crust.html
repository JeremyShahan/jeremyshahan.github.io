						<h2>Description</h2>
						<div class="Description">
							<p>
								A pie crust is the pastry shell, typically made with flour, fat (like butter or shortening), water,
								and salt, that forms the container for a pie, often creating a flaky and tender texture when baked.
								This recipe is made without flour and is glute-free although one of the ingredients in the
								gluten-free flour is Xanthan gum which supposedly can still cause issues for individuals who have
								more severe sensitivities to gluten. It is still considered safe even for individuals with Celiac,
								but some individuals have reported having minor symptoms. This recipe is intended for a 12 inch
								pie and makes two pie crusts.

					  <h2>Instructions</h2>
					  <div class="row">
					    <div class="col-12-medium">
					      <h3>Dough Recipe</h3>
					      <ul>
					        <li>In a large bowl add in 3 and 3/4 cups of Better Batter gluten free flour.</li>
					        <li>Add in all sticks of the butter by cutting it into the bowl.</li>
					        <li>Mix until the dough resembles a crumbly texture about the size of small peas. I usually use my hands to mix because it is easier but a firm spatula can also do the job.</li>
					        <li>Add in the 3/4 teaspoons of salt, the 3 tablespoons of sugar, the 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar, and the 2 eggs.</li>
					        <li>Stir, mixing in the ingredients.</li>
					        <li>Work the dough with your hands until it comes together to form a loose, large ball. It should stick together pretty easily.</li>
					        <li>If it does not stick together, add 1-2 teaspoons water and work the dough some more.</li>
					        <li>Divide the dough into 2 equal parts and form each into a ball.</li>
					        <li>Place each dough ball on a large sheet of parchment paper and fold the paper over and press each ball into a disc.</li>
					        <li>Wrap up both discs and place it in the refrigerator. Allow the dough to chill for 1-2 hours.</li>
					        <li>If the dough has been chilled for longer than 2 hours, let it come to room temperature for 30-60 minutes before rolling it out.</li>
									<li>If you do not intend to use the dough right away, you can store it in the freezer.</li>
					      </ul>
					      <h3>Rolling out the Dough</h3>
					      <ul>
					        <li>Remove the dough from the parchment paper and dust the paper lightly with flour. Place the dough back onto the parchment paper.</li>
					        <li>Dust the top of the dough lightly with flour and add another sheet of parchment paper on top.</li>
					        <li>Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 1/8 to a 1/4 inch thick round crust. If the dough starts to stick to the parchment paper, repeat the light dusting process with flour.</li>
									<li>Since a 12 inch pie crust is so large it may not be very easy to place the dough in the pie plate without it falling apart. I recommend placing the dough on a cuting board and placing the pie plate upside down centered on the dough.</li>
					        <li>Then carefully holding the cutting board and pie plate you can flip everything over and let the dough fall into place in the plate. Gently press the dough into the pie plate, trim the excess dough from the edges, and leave enough to create a thick edge. Fill in the thinner spots as needed with the excess dough.</li>
					        <li>Add a decorative pattern to the edge if desired.</li>
					        <li>Press a fork 5-6 times into the bottom of the pie crust. This will help the pie crust stay flat and not bubble up when baking or pre-baking.</li>
					      </ul>
